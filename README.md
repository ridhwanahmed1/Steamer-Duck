## Your Project Answers

### Project Description

We want to use the board to control a platform game (similar to Mario) called Red Runner. Here is the github link: [RedRunner] (https://github.com/drummyfish/Steamer-Duck)
### Technical Approach

We plan to use a combination of the touch sensor or joy stick controller, and buttons from the board to be the inputs to the Red Runner game which is ran in a Python GUI.

We want to use the buttons on the board as select and back buttons to navigate the menu, and if using the touch sensor to move right and left, the buttons to make the character jump up or crouch. If we use a joy stick controller, we can have all the character movement controlled by it.
