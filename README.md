## STEAMER DUCK

### Project Description

We want to use the board to control a platform game (similar to Mario) called Steamer Duck. Here is the github link: [Steamer Duck] (https://github.com/drummyfish/Steamer-Duck)

### Technical Approach and game description 

Streamer Duck is a level based 2d platform game which has a general objective of gathering as many eggs as possible while avoiding obstacles in the form of flying drones and enemy robots. Additionally, there is a scoring objective to optimize performance that comes in the form of gathering as many coins as possible in the shortest amount of time. Previous scores are saved via a leaderboard as a way to gauge performance and promote competitiveness. We use the FRDM-KL46Z microcontroller as our main driver for this game and incorporate joystick controls via the 2 ADC ports allocated on the board.

Original project was part of my embedded systems final project. While some of the files may have been included via upload and zip, the entirety exists in my coe.cis repo which can be linked here: https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/ra495/Steamer-Duck
